# JavaScript Basics

Q) What is JavaScript?

A) JavaScript is a programming language. It was originally created to run inside web browsers and used to make web pages interactive and dynamic. However, now JavaScript can be used in many different environments: web servers, mobile, desktop, and IoT devices. Some key characteristics of JavaScript are:

* High-level: you don't have to manage memory or worry about the computer's hardware.
* Interpreted: it runs directly in different environments without compiling.
* Dynamically typed: you don't have to declare data types explicitly.
* Cross paradigm: you can use object-oriented, procedural, and functional programming styles.
* Single-threaded with event loops: handles multiple tasks asynchronously using the event loop.

Q) Why use JavaScript?

A) The key reasons for using JavaScript are:

* Essential for web development: JavaScript is one of the three essential technologies required for web development: HTML (structure), CSS (styling), and JavaScript (behaviour). Without JavaScript much of the website and web apps won't work.

* Ideal for real-time and dynamic apps: JavaScript is single-threaded with event loops. It supports AJAX, fetch API, and promises. JavaScript can handle multiple tasks asynchronously. As a result it is ideal for real-time and dynamic apps and features. For example, chat apps, notifications, and live feeds.

* Enables interactive UI development: JavaScript can be used to build interactive and dynamic user interfaces (UIs) via popular libraries such as React, Vue, and Angular.

* Supports cross-platform development: JavaScript runs in many different evironments: web browsers, web servers, mobile, desktop, and IoT devices. As a result it can be used to build websites, web apps, mobile apps, APIs, desktop apps, and IoT apps.

* Massive ecosystem and community: JavaScript is one of the most popular and widely used programming language. It powers some of the most popular open source projects such as: React, Node.js, Next.js, and many more. Additonally, there are millions of JavaScript packages on NPM, for different use cases.
